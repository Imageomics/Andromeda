# Data Retrieval Information

Landcover percentages were generated with the code in [`mapping.py`](https://github.com/Imageomics/Andromeda/blob/main/datasets/data_retrieval/mapping.py) and [`mapping_broad.py`](https://github.com/Imageomics/Andromeda/blob/main/datasets/data_retrieval/mapping_broad.py).

[`updating_regions_local.ipynb`](https://github.com/Imageomics/Andromeda/blob/main/datasets/data_retrieval/updating_regions_local.ipynb) used functions from `mapping.py` to fetch and manipulate the data, while  
`mapping_broad.py` was used directly to generate the broad regions. 

**Note:** The local notebook utilizes login information for an ArcGIS developer account, while `mapping_broad.py` requires an API key for ArcGIS. 

The reference CSVs were generated using the first parts of `CSV_editing_local.ipynb` and `CSV_editing_broad.ipynb`, respectively. These notebooks were also used after data collection to knit together all the data into [`landcover-nj-2023.csv`](https://github.com/Imageomics/Andromeda/blob/main/datasets/satelliteData/landcover-nj-2023.csv) for use with Andromeda.



### Note on ArcGIS Install 

It requires first installing `urllib3` version 1.26.0 (until the fall 2023 update of `arcgis` package). These files used `arcgis` version 2.1.0.3.

#### For M1 & M2 Macs:

The `arcgis` package is not yet native to Apple Silicon, so it requires Rosetta 2 emulating Intel i386 architecture (see note [here](https://joelmccune.com/install-arcgis-python-api-on-apple-silicon/) on Conda setup).
